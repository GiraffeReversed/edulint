flake8-json~=24.4.0 # 24.4.0 is tested to be compatible
pylint>=3,<3.4  # 3.3.1 is tested to be compatible; Assertions in tests failed for Pylint 3.3 - the code reached supposedly unreachable section.
dataclasses-json~=0.6.7  # 0.6.7 is tested to be compatible
tomli~=2.0.1  # 2.0.1 is tested to be compatible. In Python 3.11+ it's included as a standard library tomllib.
